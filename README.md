Timezone Bot,

This Discord Bot will create a post where you can react to it and get a role that represents your timezone
every hour the bot will update your time role to your chosen local time

1.
when you first add this bot please create a text channel then
send "!reactionrole" into the text channel
2.
a new text channel call "startup" should be created along with your time/timezone roles
send "!init" into the channel ONLY IF ITS YOUR FIRST TIME running this code, else the bot would automatically on start up send it into that channel

3. 
if you already did 1. and 2. then you don't need to do anything more the next time you start the program.

if you are adding or removing reactions very fast the roles might take some time to update
